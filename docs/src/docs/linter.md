# Linter Usage

djLint includes many rules to check the style and validity of your templates. Take full advantage of the linter by configuring it to use a preset profile for the template language of your choice.

```bash
djlint /path/to/templates --lint

# with custom extensions
djlint /path/to/templates -e html.dj --profile=django

# or to file
djlint /path/to/this.html.j2  --profile=jinja
```

<div class="box notification is-info is-light">
    <span class="icon is-large"><i class="fas fa-2x fa-circle-arrow-right"></i></span><div class="my-auto ml-3 is-inline-block"><a href="/docs/configuration/">Check out the configuration guide for all the options!</a></div>
</div>

## Enabling or Disabling Rules

Most rules are enabled by default. Rules can be disabled in the command line with the `--ignore` flag. Rules can be enabled with the `--include` flag.

For example:

```bash
djlint . --lint --include=H017,H035 --ignore=H013,H015
```

This can also be done through the [{{ "configuration" | i18n }}]({{ "lang_code_url" | i18n }}/docs/configuration) file.

### Code Patterns

The first letter of a code follows the pattern:

::: content

- D: applies specifically to Django
- H: applies to html
- J: applies specifically to Jinja
- M: applies specifically to Handlebars
- N: applies specifically to Nunjucks
- T: applies generally to templates
  :::

### Adding Rules

We welcome pull requests with new rules!

A good rule consists of

::: content

- Name
- Code
- Message - Message to display when error is found.
- Flags - Regex flags. Defaults to re.DOTALL. ex: re.I|re.M
- Patterns - regex expressions that will find the error.
- Exclude - Optional list of profiles to exclude rule from.
  :::

Please include a test to validate the rule.

## Custom Rules

You can add custom rules just for your project by creating a `.djlint_rules.yaml` alongside
your `pyproject.toml`. Rules can be added to this files and djLint will pick them up.

### Pattern Rules

You can add rules that fails if one of the regex pattern has a match:

```yaml
- rule:
    name: T001
    message: Find Trichotillomania
    flags: re.DOTALL|re.I
    patterns:
      - Trichotillomania
```

### Python module Rules

You can add rules that import and execute a custom python function:

```yaml
- rule:
    name: T001
    message: Found the 'bad' word
    python_module: your_package.your_module
```

The specified `python_module` must contain a `run()` function that will be executed on
every checked file. It must accept the following arguments:

::: content

- `rule`: The dict that represent your rule in `.djlint_rules.yaml`. You will typically
  use this variable to access the rule name and message.
- `config`: The DJLint configuration object.
- `html`: The full html content of the file.
- `filepath`: Path to the file that we are currently checking.
- `line_ends`: List of line `start` and `end` character position that you can use with
  `djlint.lint.get_line()` to get line numbers from a character position. See the exemple.
- `*args, **kwargs`: We might add other arguments in the future, so you should include
  those two arguments to reduce the risk of failure on djLint upgrade.
  :::

It must return a list of dict, one for each errors, with the following keys:

::: content

- `code`: Code name of the rule that report the error (typically `rule['name']`)
- `line`: Line number and character number on this line, separated by a ':' as a string.
  For example `"2:3"` means that the error has been found on line 2, character 3
- `match`: The part of the content that contains the error
- `message`: The message that will be printed to signal the error (typically `rule['message']`)
  :::

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List
from djlint.settings import Config
from djlint.lint import get_line
import re

def run(
    rule: Dict[str, Any],
    config: djlint.settings.Config,
    html: str,
    filepath: str,
    line_ends: List[Dict[str, int]],
    *args: Any,
    **kwargs: Any,
) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    """
    Rule that fails if if the html file contains 'bad'. This is just an exemple, in
    reality it's much simpler to do that with "pattern rule".
    """
    errors: List[Dict[str, str]] = []
    for match in re.finditer(r"bad", html):
        errors.append(
            {
                "code": rule["name"],
                "line": get_line(match.start(), line_ends),
                "match": match.group().strip()[:20],
                "message": rule["message"],
            }
        )
    return errors
```
